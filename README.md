# Covid-19_RNN-LSTM-_Keras
This is a small project regarding prediction of corona virus daily new confirmed cases worldwide with the help of LSTM model using keras implementation
The dataset is very small for deep learning to work effectively so this is just the trial that i make hence predictions are not even close to the reality.
the dataset is being taken from https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 and it is updated daily.
I have used LSTM model for predition purposes.
### Results

the red line is of predicted cases for recent 4 days

### HOPE THIS VIRUS ENDS SOON
### Stay Safe
